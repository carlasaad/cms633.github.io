Through our investigation we would like to address how the three monotheistic religions meet and overlapp in meaning. We envision having people explore how different words travel from one plane to another and change according the interpretation of each religion through the sentences used.
For this task we are basing the input on the three books: The bible: old testament and new testament and Qoran where we track the use of the words and sentences and expose them to unpack in front of the eyes of the audience.

Since the display is combining between artistic and religious reading, we are targeting museum visitors who would like to expand their understanding of spiritual texts.
For this installation we need skills focused in physical prototyping and fabrication to build the physical frame, Processing skills and using Miscroft Kinect to add the interative aspect in addition to manipulation with arduino.
